# Image Persistence Fix

## Problem

Images were not persisting in the chat history. When a new message was sent, previous images would disappear from the chat.

**Example of the issue:**
1. User asks for annotated image â†’ Shows annotated image
2. User asks for original image â†’ Annotated image disappears, shows original
3. User asks for new snapshot â†’ Original disappears, shows new snapshot

**Root cause**: Streamlit re-renders the entire chat on each interaction. Images were only displayed in the current response, not stored in chat history.

---

## Solution

Store image paths in the chat message history so they persist across re-renders.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Message History Structure** (Updated)

**Before:**
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How busy is it?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Beach is moderate..."}
]
```

**After:**
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How busy is it?"},
    {
        "role": "assistant", 
        "content": "Beach is moderate...",
        "image_path": "data/snapshots/beach_123.jpg",  # âœ… Added
        "image_caption": "Annotated Beach Snapshot"     # âœ… Added
    }
]
```

#### 2. **Message Display** (Updated)

**Before:**
```python
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])  # Only text
```

**After:**
```python
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        # Display image if present âœ…
        if "image_path" in message and message["image_path"]:
            image_path = message["image_path"]
            if Path(image_path).exists():
                caption = message.get("image_caption", "Beach Image")
                st.image(str(image_path), caption=caption, width="stretch")
        
        # Then display text
        st.markdown(message["content"])
```

#### 3. **Image Tracking** (New)

Track images throughout the response handling:

```python
# Initialize at the start
image_to_save = None
image_caption = None

# When displaying an image
if snapshot_path:
    st.image(str(snapshot_path), caption=caption, width="stretch")
    image_to_save = str(snapshot_path)  # âœ… Save for history
    image_caption = caption              # âœ… Save caption

# When saving to history
message_data = {
    "role": "assistant", 
    "content": response
}
if image_to_save:
    message_data["image_path"] = image_to_save      # âœ… Include image
    message_data["image_caption"] = image_caption   # âœ… Include caption

st.session_state.messages.append(message_data)
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Example Conversation:

**User**: "How many people on beach?"
```
Agent Response:
- Text: "Beach is moderate with 10 people..."
- Stored in history: {content: "...", image_path: null}
```

**User**: "yes" (to see annotated image)
```
Agent Response:
- Image: Annotated snapshot
- Text: "Here is the annotated image..."
- Stored in history: {
    content: "...", 
    image_path: "data/snapshots/beach_123_annotated.jpg",
    image_caption: "Annotated Beach Snapshot"
  }
```

**User**: "show me the original"
```
Agent Response:
- Image: Original snapshot
- Text: "Here is the original image..."
- Stored in history: {
    content: "...", 
    image_path: "data/snapshots/beach_123.jpg",
    image_caption: "Original Beach Snapshot"
  }
```

**Result**: When Streamlit re-renders, it displays:
1. âœ… First message (text only)
2. âœ… Second message (annotated image + text)
3. âœ… Third message (original image + text)

**All images persist!** ðŸŽ‰

## Additional Improvements

### 1. **Removed Debug Statements**
Cleaned up debug `st.write()` calls that were cluttering the UI.

### 2. **Updated to `width` Parameter**
Changed from deprecated `use_container_width=True` to `width="stretch"` to avoid Streamlit warnings.

### 3. **Consistent Image Handling**
All code paths (annotated, original, fresh snapshot) now follow the same pattern for image storage.

---

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Multiple Images in Chat
```
1. Ask: "How many people on beach?"
2. Say: "yes" (annotated image appears)
3. Ask: "show me the original" (original appears)
4. Ask: "what does it look like now" (fresh snapshot appears)
5. Scroll up â†’ All 3 images should still be visible âœ…
```

### Test Case 2: Image Captions
```
1. Annotated image â†’ Caption: "Annotated Beach Snapshot"
2. Original image â†’ Caption: "Original Beach Snapshot (from recent analysis)"
3. Fresh snapshot â†’ Caption: "Fresh Beach Snapshot"
```

### Test Case 3: Missing Images
```
1. If image file is deleted after being displayed
2. On re-render, it won't show (graceful handling)
3. Text still displays correctly
```

## Files Changed

- âœ… `ui/chat.py` - Complete rewrite of image handling
  - Added image storage to message history
  - Updated message display loop to show images
  - Track `image_to_save` and `image_caption` throughout response handling
  - Updated all code paths to save images consistently

---

## Benefits

âœ… **Images persist** - All images stay in chat history  
âœ… **Multiple images** - Can show annotated, original, and fresh snapshots simultaneously  
âœ… **Clean UI** - No debug clutter  
âœ… **Future-proof** - Uses new Streamlit `width` parameter  
âœ… **Consistent** - Same pattern for all image types  

---

## Summary

The chat now properly stores and displays images across all messages. Users can request multiple images and scroll back to see all of them, just like a normal chat application!

**Before**: Only the most recent image was visible  
**After**: All images persist in chat history âœ…
