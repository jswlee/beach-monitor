# Final Fixes - Annotated Image Display Bug

## Bug Fixed

### Issue: `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'snapshot_displayed'`

**Error occurred when**: User said "yes" to seeing the annotated image

**Root cause**: Variable `snapshot_displayed` was only initialized in some code branches, not all

**Fix**: Initialize `snapshot_displayed = False` at the top of the response handling block, before any branching logic

---

## Code Changes

### Before (Buggy):
```python
if st.session_state.get("show_image_prompt"):
    if prompt.lower() in ["yes", "sure", "ok"]:
        # Show annotated image
        # snapshot_displayed NOT initialized here! ‚ùå
    elif prompt.lower() in ["no", "nope"]:
        # snapshot_displayed NOT initialized here! ‚ùå
    else:
        # snapshot_displayed initialized here
        snapshot_displayed = False
else:
    # snapshot_displayed initialized here
    snapshot_displayed = False

# Later...
if snapshot_displayed:  # ‚ùå ERROR if came from first two branches!
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Initialize FIRST, before any branching ‚úÖ
snapshot_displayed = False

if st.session_state.get("show_image_prompt"):
    if prompt.lower() in ["yes", "sure", "ok"]:
        # Show annotated image
        # snapshot_displayed already initialized ‚úÖ
    elif prompt.lower() in ["no", "nope"]:
        # snapshot_displayed already initialized ‚úÖ
    else:
        # snapshot_displayed already initialized ‚úÖ
else:
    # snapshot_displayed already initialized ‚úÖ

# Later...
if snapshot_displayed:  # ‚úÖ Always works!
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Say "yes" to annotated image
```
1. Ask: "How many people on beach?"
2. Agent: "Would you like to see the annotated image?"
3. Say: "yes"
4. Expected: Annotated image displays, no error ‚úÖ
```

### Test Case 2: Say "no" to annotated image
```
1. Ask: "How many people on beach?"
2. Agent: "Would you like to see the annotated image?"
3. Say: "no"
4. Expected: "No problem..." message, no error ‚úÖ
```

### Test Case 3: Ask new question instead
```
1. Ask: "How many people on beach?"
2. Agent: "Would you like to see the annotated image?"
3. Ask: "Show me the original image"
4. Expected: Original image displays, no error ‚úÖ
```

## Original Image Display Issue

**Status**: Investigating

The original image shows as broken in the UI. Debugging steps added:
1. Show the path being checked
2. Show if file exists
3. List available images in directory if file not found

**Next steps**:
1. Run the app with debug output enabled
2. Check what path is being returned by `get_original_image_tool`
3. Verify file actually exists at that path
4. Check if path format is correct for Streamlit

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `ui/chat.py` - Fixed `snapshot_displayed` initialization bug
- ‚úÖ `ui/chat.py` - Added debug output for image display troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ `ui/chat.py` - Added better error handling for image display

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Bug fixed**: `snapshot_displayed` UnboundLocalError resolved  
üîç **Investigating**: Original image display issue (broken image icon)  
üìù **Debug enabled**: Will show path and file existence info  

Run the app and try saying "yes" to the annotated image - the error should be gone!

For the original image issue, the debug output will help identify the problem.
